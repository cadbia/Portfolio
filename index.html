In my free time, I like to play golf, tennis, and baseball. I have two older siblings and a very cute dog. My siblings and I share very diffeent interests. This portfolio was created to share my intests and passion projects in computer science with you. In fact, this very portfolio was created using html. If you would like to view a directory of these projects, feel free to click the computer :)</h3>
