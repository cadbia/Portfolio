        <h3>Hi, I am Caden Bialow and this is my portfolio. I am going into my Junior year of high school. My biggest passions are computer science and engineering. In my free time, I like to play golf, tennis, and baseball. I have two older siblings and a very cute dog. My siblings and I share very diffeent interests. This portfolio was created to share my intests and passion projects in computer science with you. In fact, this very portfolio was created using html.
